## Page Naming

- Page names should be in PascalCase.
- Page names should be what the page route is + Page.
- If the pages has the components that are used in that page only, the create a folder `_components` inside the folder and put the components in that folder. THe components name should be as ComponentName + Component.

## Using CSS

- If the classNames are being used more than once in a component, then create a variable for that className and use it.

## One branch one Issue

- Create a branch for each issue itself and work on that issue in that branch only.

## Deletion of branch after task completion

- Whoever merges the branch should delete the branch after merging it to the main branch.
- If the branch is merged, don't work on that branch again. Create a new branch for the new issue.
